## About Emergent Motion

Each ball is governed by two rules:

 * Each ball feels an attraction to every other ball based on (a butchered version of) [newtons universal gravitation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation).
 * If two balls overlap at any time, instead of feeling attraction, the force is converted to a repulsive force that pushes the balls away from each other.

Through these two rules a weird, entirely physics-based, organism is created.

Perhaps most interesting is that if the initial conditions were not random, the simulation would be entirely deterministic. Even though the behavior appears random, if you were to start two simulations with the same initial conditions, they should behave identically. There is something profound in this that relates deeply with our understanding of physics and the natural world. Even a slight variation in initial conditions can produce a dramatically different result.
